# UNO
A Discord bot to play UNO with your friends
## How it works
!uno to start a game
You can use discord reactions to join, leave or stop a game
It will say what different reactions do
The bot will then make a private channel for each player and remove the admin role so that they cannot access the other private channels and cheat.
Each player will have his own private channel where his cards will be sent and at the end there will be an embed showing what card is currently being played and who's turn it is.
To play a card you just copy it and send it to your private channel.

## How to add it to your server
To use this bot you will need to go to the discord dev website make your own application, give it admin permissions get the token, copy my code and insert your token. This is necessary as currently the bot only works on one server at a time. In addittion to this I run the code on my computer when I want to use the bot therefore it is off unless I am using it, as it is not run on a server.
I will be working on that in the near future.
It may also have a few bugs if you do weird things with it or if you do stuff too quicky and you don't wait for it to load; if you use it properly then you should not have any problems, or atleast I didn't.
